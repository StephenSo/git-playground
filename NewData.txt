The process of moving commits between branches (often from a
feature branch to master) is known as merging. It's important to
remember when merging that we need to be on the branch that
we want to merge to before performing the merge, as the merge
will be represented as a new commit on that branch.
In this case, we want to merge from the "my-feature" branch,
where we've made our changes, to the master branch. Switch
back to the master branch if you aren't already on it (you can use
git branch to check).
