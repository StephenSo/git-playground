For that reason, one of the most common
workflows that is followed when using Git is to
create a new branch, make your changes as a
series of commits on that branch, and then
merge that branch into master when done.
This has a number of benefits, allowing related
changes to be grouped together, and
simplifying the process of integrating changes
from different developers.
